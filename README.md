# Latex_Documents_with_R_and_Python
This project aims to combine in a LaTeX document standard text with chunks of code, particulary chunks of R code and Python code.

Any feedback is welcome, üòÑ so please feel free to ask or comment anything you want. If you are shy üò≥ and do not want to
write in the repo, I will be happy to answer you by email at asuncionjc@us.es üë©üèª‚Äçüíª .

## Goals

The goal of this repo is to give the steps to write LaTeX documents which include chunks of R and Python code. These chunks of code can be executed or not according to the requirements.

## How it works?

To develop this project, the LaTeX package [listings](https://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/listings/) will be used. As far as I know, such library allows not only to write code as in an standard IDE as RStudio or PyCharm, but to include your own .R and .py scripts.

## Previous requirements

To write documents using LaTeX, it is obviously necessary to have the tools to do it. Although the installation of LaTeX exceeds the goals of this repo, [here](https://www.latex-tutorial.com/installation/) you can find how to do it.
