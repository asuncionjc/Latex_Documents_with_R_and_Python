# Latex_Documents_with_R_and_Python
This project aims to combine in a LaTeX document standard text with chunks of code, particulary chunks of R code and Python code.

Any feedback is welcome, üòÑ so please feel free to ask or comment anything you want. If you are shy üò≥ and do not want to
write in the repo, I will be happy to answer you by email at asuncionjc@us.es üë©üèª‚Äçüíª .

## Goals

The goal of this repo is to give the steps to write LaTeX documents which include chunks of R and Python code. These chunks of code can be executed or not according to the requirements.

## How it works?

To develop this project, the LaTeX package [pythontex](https://ctan.org/pkg/pythontex) will be used. This package has been developed by [Geoffrey Poore](https://github.com/gpoore). The link to the Github repository can be found [here](https://github.com/gpoore/pythontex).

## Previous requirements

To write documents using LaTeX and execute chunks of R and Python code, it is obviously necessary to have the tools to do it. Although the installation of LaTeX, R and Python exceeds the goals of this repo, I suggest you some references to download and install them. Particularly, [here](https://www.latex-tutorial.com/installation/) you can find how to install Latex. Regarding R, [this page](https://www.r-project.org/) is recommended for the programme and [this one](https://www.rstudio.com/) to get the well known IDE, RStudio. Finally, downloading the IDE Pycharm [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), you will get also a version of Python.
