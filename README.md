# Latex_Documents_with_R_and_Python
This project aims to combine in a LaTeX document standard text with chunks of code, particulary chunks of R code and Python code.

Any feedback is welcome, üòÑ so please feel free to ask or comment anything you want. If you are shy üò≥ and do not want to
write in the repo, I will be happy to answer you by email at asuncionjc@us.es üë©üèª‚Äçüíª .

## Goals

The goal of this repo is to give the steps to write LaTeX documents which include chunks of R and Python code. These chunks of code can be executed or not according to the requirements.

## How it works?

To develop this project, the LaTeX package [pythontex](https://ctan.org/pkg/pythontex) will be used. This package has been developed by [Geoffrey Poore](https://github.com/gpoore). The link to its Github repository can be found [here](https://github.com/gpoore/pythontex).

## Previous requirements

To write documents using LaTeX and execute chunks of R and Python code, it is obviously necessary to have the tools to do it. Although the installation of LaTeX, R and Python exceeds the goals of this repo, I suggest you some references to download and install them. Particularly, [here](https://www.latex-tutorial.com/installation/) you can find how to install Latex. Regarding R, [this page](https://www.r-project.org/) is recommended for the programme and [this one](https://www.rstudio.com/) to get the well known IDE, RStudio. Finally, downloading the IDE Pycharm [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), you will get also a version of Python.

For more information about the programme versions, I recommend you to read [this link](https://github.com/gpoore/pythontex/blob/master/pythontex/pythontex.pdf).

### Install non-default Python packages

Some Python packages are required for using pythontex, namely `pygments`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib` and `sympy`. In the next lines, I will explain how to do it in a MAC computer. The steps for the installation in Linux or Windows platforms will be given soon. 

The first thing we need to know is: Which Python packages do I have? To ask this question you have to open a terminal and follow these steps:

1) Call `python`.
2) Type `help('modules)`
3) Check the list of modules.

A screencast which shows the process can be seen below:

Once we know which packages are installed and which ones are missed, we need to proceed to the installation of some non-default packages. To this aim, you have to be sure that `pip` (a tool for installing Python packages is installed). Otherwise, you will get errors like this:

![error_no_pip_installed](./videos_and_images_for_the_readme_file/error_pip_not_installed.png)

To install `pip` you just have to open a terminal and follow these steps:

1) Write `sudo easy_install pip`.
2) Type the password of your Mac.
3) Now, `pip` is installed.

If you have doubts, then have a look at this video:
